Date: May 24rd 2011


This is a preliminary manual for alternative firmware for FlySky FS-GT3B radio
and clones. This manual is written as differences to original firmware.

This firmware is completely written from scratch and is not compatible with the
original Flysky firmware. It is distributed with NO-WARRANTY.
All of the model setups saved by original firmware will be erased!!!
You can backup your original firmware and config, use tabs "PROGRAM MEMORY" and
"DATA MEMORY" in STVP to read it from radio a save it to disk.



Global characteristics:
=======================
- up to 40 models memory (will be less at the future after adding more
	functions and more channels)
    > numbers 10-19 will show with Right-Arrow
    > numbers 20-29 will show with Left-Arrow
    > numbers 30-39 will show with both arrows
- added Subtrims
- added SaveAs to save model config to another memory location
- added Global Setup menu to change function features, including backlight time,
    CH3 behavior, etc. 
- dead zone for steering and throttle
- calibrate menu will be automatically invoked after first power-on with
  this firmware, so 6 menu items will start to blink


Buttons:
========
- it is now possible to differentiate between long press (>1 second) to
  normal button press (short) and it will be recognized like "ENTER-long"
- buttons of CH3 trims are now also used for steering trim
- Trims and DualRate
    > now shows changed value only temporaly (5 seconds or till another
	key press), values are saved to EEPROm automatically when it disappears
    > when autorepeat disabled on trims (default), reset trim to 0
	by pressing both trim keys together for long
	(eg. TRIM_LEFT-long + TRIM_RIGHT-long and similar for channel 2)


Standard menu:
==============
- Trims are now only for steering and throttle
- Expo
    > value for channel 2 is splitted to forward and back and is indicated
	by arrows
    > positive values are those You want to use like at Spektrum radios
- DualRate
    > value for channel 2 is splitted to forward and back and is indicated
	by arrows
- SaveAs
    > choose menu MODEL and press ENTER-long
    > menu MODEL will blink
    > choose memory position where to save model config
    > press ENTER/BACK to save it
- Model reset
    > choose menu NAME and press ENTER-long
- Subtrims
    > choose menu TRIM and press ENTER-long
    > menu TRIM will blink
    > set subtrims for each channel
    > press ENTER/BACK to end this submenu


Calibrate menu:
===============
- enter it by wheel right-turn and ENTER-long
- 6 menu items starts to blink
- use END or ROTATE to change channels
- there is also channel 3 representing CH3 button (for those who will do
    some 3-position switch/potentiometer modification)
- there is also channal 4 representing battery voltage
- calibrate as usual (for channel 1/2 left+mid+right and ENTER)
    > calibrated value will disappear from menu
    > it is not needed to calibrate all values
- calibrate battery (it will not be probably needed to use this)
    > select channel 4
    > press ENTER
    > set your current battery voltage (measure it by voltmeter)
    > press ENTER to save it or END to no-save
- press BACK-long or ENTER-long to end calibrate menu and save values


Key-test menu:
==============
- enter it by wheel left-turn and ENTER-long
- if ENTER-long keep pressed, all segments on display will stay on till
    ENTER is released
- now check keys by pressing them short or long
- if keys long pressed, an "L" symbol will appear left to displayed key symbols
- press BACK-long or ENTER-long to end key-test menu


Global setup menu:
==================
- enter it by ENTER-long
- now menu items MODEL and NAME will start blinking
- select requested item by ROTATE and press ENTER
- use ROTATE to change value and press ENTER to end value changing
- press BACK-long or ENTER-long to end global setup menu,
    values will be saved to EEPROM
- selected menu items are indicated by following symbols:
    F		firmware version (this of course cannot be changed :-)
    L		backlight time			5s,10s...10m...MAX
    LOW POWER!	battery low voltage		7.5...10.5V
    E.POINT	maximum allowed endpoint value	100...150%
		DANGER - values greater than 120% can damage
			    your servo or will not be possible
			    to transmit to receiver because of
			    2.4GHz HF module limitation
		This danger zone will be indicated with a flashing "d" symbol
		  for values greater than 120%
    TRIM + S	trim step for trim buttons	1...20
    1		dead zone for steering		0...50
    2		dead zone for throttle		0...50
    3		CH3 buttons is momentary	OFF/ON
    b		key beep			OFF/ON
    TRIM + A	autorepeat for trim buttons	OFF/ON
    D/R + A	autorepeat for dualrate buttons	OFF/ON
    r + ALL	global reset - change to YES to set global configuration
			       and all models to default values
    r + MOD	all models reset - change to YES to set all models
				   to default values



Return to original (and modified) firmware:
===========================================
    - flash original firmware
    - delete whole EEPROM (tab DATA MEMORY in STVP and write those empty zeroes)
      or return back your saved config (also tab DATA MEMORY in STVP, read
      your saved config from disk and write it to radio)
    - calibrate steering and throttle (not needed when You returned back saved
      config)
