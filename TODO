    ? use one(more) button as SHIFT/SHIFT-LOCK

losikid67:
On mixing for crawling applications will need to be able to mix Throttle to an
AUX channel (channel 3) and to be able to adjust the mix rate via 3 way switch
when not programming. So for ex. when the 3 way switch is pushed down it will
decrease the percentage by 10%. So the slave will be 90% of the master channel.
If it is pushed up it will increase the the percentage 10% So the slave will be
110% of the master channel. Also it would need need another 3 position switch
that in center position the radio uses the above mixing features, but the outer
positions will connect just the throttle or Aux channel to the trigger, the
inactive channel will be sent to center.
As its basic functions. If possible, other functions could include adjustable
step rate (so not a set 10%) and auto return, so if you change direction of
click it will return to 100% mix.
Also at least one additional channel could be useful. Preferably have them
support 3 position switches. OR have them as virtual channels since i/o's are
limited. It be another mix, steering mix for 4 wheel steer.
