linear CH3 with potentiometer
    - global option to choose CH3 is a pot
    - don't read CH3 key in read_keys()
    - key mapping assign trim function and reverse
    - at begin of CALC, convert CH3 val to assigned function
    - calibrate low and high values at calib menu
? use also flash memory to store model configs
    - some models in EEPROM
    - other models in FLASH, one empty place
    - table in EEPROM mapping model numbers to EEPROM/FLASH pos
    - order table of used EEPROM models
    - when FLASH model requested, move least used EEPROM model to empty
	FLASH pos and requested FLASH model to this EEPROM pos
    - use Word FLASH/EEPROM programming
    - do one 8-channel fw with global default channels setting
    - check if STVP erases whole flash
? more multi-positions - 2 for 6ch, 4 for 8ch, 4-pos is enought

? PPM input for head tracking gyro
    - pin PD7 TLI non-maskable interrupt at signal edge
    - or pin PD1 (SWIM), PD5, PD6 with pin change interrupt at signal edge
	- set timer_interrupt and ppm_interrupt to lower level as it
	  can be interrupted by PPM in signal
    - read timer register, timer_1s, timer_5s to cyclic buffer
    - wakeup PPM_INPUT task
	- read values from cyclic buffer
	- compute PPM servo signals and assign them to ppm_in variables
