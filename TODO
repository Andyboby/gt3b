timer
    - up/down/lap
    - ignore lap button after press for 3 seconds to eliminate double clicks
    - lap time - after press show last time for 3s and then current time
	       - somewhere show list of lap times
    - start with throttle
    - main screens - ENTER stops and allows to set alarm/throttle start/
		     show lap counts
    - TimerUpReset - stop+reset to 0
    - TimerUpStart - start/stop
	- alarm
    - TimerDownReset - stop+reset to alarm time
    - TimerDownStart - reset to alarm time+restart
	- alarm - then count up
    - TimerLapReset - stop/reset
    - TimerLapInc - start/count/stop after alarm
	- alarm
    - LapCountInc - count
    - time format
	00.0 % - 2-minutes, 1-10ths seconds
	000  % - 1-minutes, 2-seconds
	00.0   - 2-seconds, 1-0.1 seconds
	000    - 1-seconds, 2-0.01 seconds
timer losikid
    1 or 2 timers on extra main screens
    ENTER selects timers settings
	timer type
	    lap timer - alarm, @lap, @stop, reset (at lap times screen)
		ignore lap button for 3s
		show lap time for 3s
	    lap counter - @lap, @reset
		alarm after num laps
		ignore lap button for 3s
	    count up - alarm, @pause, @reset
	    cound down - alarm, @pause, @reset (save rest to lap timers)
	    ? lap timer down - laps_count
	alarm
	throttle start
    ENTER-long selects lap times
	look at times
	reset all data

? linear CH3 with potentiometer
    - global option to choose CH3 is a pot
    - don't read CH3 key in read_keys()
    - key mapping assign trim function and reverse
    - at begin of CALC, convert CH3 val to assigned function
    - calibrate low and high values at calib menu
? selectable frame length with constant frame/constant sync
    - global option to choose constant frame/constant sync (9ms..)
    - global option to set frame/sync length (3ms..)
    - add code to ppm_calc_sync() to use global options
? more multi-positions - 2 for 6ch, 4 for 8ch, 4-pos is enought
? use also flash memory to store model configs
    possibility to copy model stored at flash
? PPM input for head tracking gyro
    - pin PD7 TLI non-maskable interrupt at signal edge
    - or pin PD1 (SWIM), PD5, PD6 with pin change interrupt at signal edge
	- set timer_interrupt and ppm_interrupt to lower level as it
	  can be interrupted by PPM in signal
    - read timer register, timer_1s, timer_5s to cyclic buffer
    - wakeup PPM_INPUT task
	- read values from cyclic buffer
	- compute PPM servo signals and assign them to ppm_in variables

? digital/custom switches (set when some conditions are satisfied)
? not so smooth servo travel



Some suggestions taken from manuals of other radios:

? CH3-8 position settable from menu
