CALC - calc at end of SYNC signal
	- measure durations of CALC
	- at end of CALC PPM pulse and servo pulses
	- after last servo pulse SYNC with time frame_len - calc_len
	  without PPM pulse, after that activate CALC
	- maybe constant length servo pulse

check inactivity as compare to previous value and not center value
shut-off low-battery beeping

timer
    - up/down/lap
    - ignore lap button after press for 3 seconds to eliminate double clicks
    - lap time - after press show last time for 3s and then current time
	       - somewhere show list of lap times
    - start with throttle
    - main screens - ENTER stops and allows to set alarm/throttle start/
		     show lap counts
    - TimerUpReset - stop+reset to 0
    - TimerUpStart - start/stop
	- alarm
    - TimerDownReset - stop+reset to alarm time
    - TimerDownStart - reset to alarm time+restart
	- alarm - then count up
    - TimerLapReset - stop/reset
    - TimerLapInc - start/count/stop after alarm
	- alarm
    - LapCountInc - count
    - time format

more multi-positions - 2 for 6ch, 4 for 8ch, 4-pos is enought
? digital/custom switches (set when some conditions are satisfied)
? not so smooth servo travel
