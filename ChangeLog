*0.5.0 ()
    global menu was restructuralized
    added ability to select number of channels (2-MAX_CHANNELS) for each
	model, less channels means less delay
    poweron warn when not-centered now has separate global option
    added up/down timers with throttle trigger start
    added BRK button function to override throttle and apply full brake
    big internal changes handling different menus, key mapping uses
	2-char option identification instead of various symbols

*0.4.2 (13 Apr 2012)
    added global setting to disable center/reset value beep
    minimum battery voltage set to 2V for those experimenting with 1S cell
    PPM signal now uses constant length of SYNC signal to get it to
	receiver as soon as possible, also servo values are calculated
	just before generating servo PPM signals to have lowest
	steering/throttle to PPM signal delay
    ADC measuring every 1ms, averaging last 4 samples when used,
	globally settable to use last 4/1 values
    added poweron beep, can be set ON/OFF in global config
    at poweron, if steering or throttle are not in center dead zone,
	beep 3 times if poweron beep is allowed
    inactivity timer compares ADC values with previous ones, so now
	it will activate when radio is not center callibrated also
    added key function BLS to shutup battery low beeper, by default is
	assigned to END-long
    3-pos switch instead of CH3 button now works

*0.4.1 (17 Aug 2011)

    minimum battery voltage set to 6V
    CH3 key set default to OFF
    added DGR key function to reset DIG mix to centre
    added posibility to select DIG instead of channel number at MultiPosition
    added lap count functions assignable to keys

*0.4.0 (18 Jul 2011)

    use steering trim when dual-ESC steering
    added channel_speed for all channels, throttle channel can be applied only
	for forward side
    repaired setting to default values for functions of config-values mapped
	to trims, this should be done only for non-config values (channel,
	mix)

*0.3.2 (27 Jun 2011)

    added option throttle brake cut of to be able to drive forward only
	vehicles (boats)
    added MultiPosition settable to channel

*0.3.1 (26 Jun 2011)

    DIG mix can be set to channel 1 to have dual-ESC steering (boat, tank, ...)

*0.3.0 (24 Jun 2011)

    added globally settable key long-press delay
    when using trims, longer beep at value reset and short pause ignoring keys
    momentary trims/keys now sets value only when state of buttons changed
	(previously it always forced value to reflect button state), so it is
	possible to map momentary and non-momentary keys to the same
	channel/mix value, also value is showed when changed
    added possibility for momentary trims and 2-state keys to return not
	to centre/left, but to previous value which was active before button
	press

*0.2.0 (9 Jun 2011)

    added 4WS mix
    added DIG mix
    added steering speed (Turn, Return)
    added inactivity alarm
    added function C3R for keys to reset channel3 value to centre
    internal changes of trims momentary/opposite_reset

*0.1.0 (2 Jun 2011)

    added special chars "-1" and "10" to be able to display values -199...1099
    both trims-long now only resets, before there was 1 press of first button
    changed EEPROM init to eliminate broken initialization
    in menu: use ENTER to switch items and END/ENTER-long to end of edit of item
    added key mapping to configuration of model and removed coresponding
      global settings (trim_step, autorepeat, ch3_momentary)
