*0.4.2 ()
    added global setting to disable center/reset value beep
    minimum battery voltage set to 2V for those experimenting with 1S cell
    PPM length shortened to "NUM_CHANNELS x 2ms + 5ms" to send new data
	to receiver as soon as possible
    ADC measuring every 1ms, averaging last 4 samples when used

*0.4.1 (17 Aug 2011)

    minimum battery voltage set to 6V
    CH3 key set default to OFF
    added DGR key function to reset DIG mix to centre
    added posibility to select DIG instead of channel number at MultiPosition
    added lap count functions assignable to keys

*0.4.0 (18 Jul 2011)

    use steering trim when dual-ESC steering
    added channel_speed for all channels, throttle channel can be applied only
	for forward side

    momentary trims/keys now sets value only when state of buttons changed
	(previously it always forced value to reflect button state), so it is
	possible to map momentary and non-momentary keys to the same
	channel/mix value, also value is showed when changed
    added possibility for momentary trims and 2-state keys to return not
	to centre/left, but to previous value which was active before button
